Linux is a family of open-source Unix-like operating systems that are built around the Linux kernel, which was first released by Linus Torvalds in 1991. Unlike proprietary operating systems like Windows or macOS, Linux allows users to view, modify, and distribute its source code, promoting collaboration and innovation within the community.
